Figure 2 shows net worker flows—hires minus separations—by educational attainment. It shows that during the recession, net hiring for the group of workers with the lowest educational attainment declined much more than for the group with the highest educational attainment; during downturns, the less educated segments of the labour market experience more adverse developments than segments for the more educated. This pattern is particularly notable during the Great Recession when the net hiring for the group with less than high school dropped by more than twice as much as for the group with the bachelor's or higher degree. While less extreme, the same pattern is observed during the milder 2001 recession.",

The reason is that a job finding rate is defined as a ratio of unemployed workers who find a job over the number of unemployed. However, in the LEHD data, we observe only hires from nonemployment, which is a broader concept than unemployment, as it also includes workers who are not in the labour force. Nevertheless, we report these \"rates\" (expressed as a share of an average employment within the education group) in the last row of Table 7, as they at least give some notion of the ranking of these rates between education groups. Note that these proxies for job finding rates are increasing with educational attainment (except for the group of less than high school, but this group is very small in the data).",
