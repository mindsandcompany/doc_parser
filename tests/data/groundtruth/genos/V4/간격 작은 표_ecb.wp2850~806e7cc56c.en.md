countercyclical employment risk, we estimate the following equation

where Yi t , is either the (net) hire or separation rate, Xt is the cyclical component of GDP, 14 educi is workers' educational attainment, γ t are time dummies to control for common shocks, and ϵ i , t is the residual term. What we are interested in is the coefficient on the interaction term, which measures the differential responsiveness - across education groups - of net hiring rate to a business cycle. Note that results have to be interpreted relative to the highest education group. 15

Notes: (Net) hires, and separations are rates and are expressed as a share of an average employment within the education group.

Table 8 reports the results from estimating Equation 11. Column 1 shows that the net hiring rate of less educated workers is more sensitive to business cycles than the net hiring rate of workers with the highest level of educational attainment. This implies that (countercyclical) employment risk is the largest for the least educated workers, and it falls with increasing educational attainment. Results are in line with Haltiwanger et al. (2018), who find that during recessions, workers with lower education are more likely to exit to nonemployment. They also find that conditional on firm productivity groups, hires and separations are more cyclically sensitive for less educated workers. In columns 2 and 3, we separate the net hiring

14 We obtain it after applying the Hodrick-Prescott filter to a logarithm of seasonally adjusted real GDP. In Appendix B.2, we also consider other business cycle measures, i.e. NBER recession episodes and the cyclical component of the level of unemployment. The results do not materially change.
